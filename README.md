Code for interacting with desmos

In the `client` folder, you will find a client that allows you to programmatically create graphs.
In the `dscript` folder is a compiler that compiles a special language called `DesmosScript` into desmos calculator state JSON.
Used together, you can create complicated desmos animations easily!
